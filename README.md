- # Britakee´s The Walking Dead Core

  - This mod does quite a few different things with only XML so it means you only need to install it on your server   (Not Client Side needed), this mod makes the game easier by making things easier to obtain early on, I did this as I work with other adults and we don't normally get a large amount of time after work to grind the game like necessary in order to get far in game.

- # Britakee´s ServerSide StarterKit

  - This mod adds a small starter kit to assist in a World full of Walker.
